# Shikha SHukla's Professional Full-Stack Portfolio

This repository hosts the source code for my professional portfolio website, a comprehensive digital resume built as a full-stack application. It is designed not only to present my work and experience but also to serve as a demonstrative example of my technical abilities across the entire web development stack.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Professional Design:** A clean, responsive, and modern UI built with **[CSS Framework, e.g., Tailwind CSS]** for excellent user experience across all devices.
* **Full-Stack Architecture:** Separated `client` (frontend) and `server` (backend) directories for scalable development.
* **API-Driven Content:** All professional data (projects, experience, skills) is served via a custom **RESTful API** built with **Node.js/Express**.
* **Robust Data Layer:** Utilizes **[Database, e.g., PostgreSQL/SQLite]** and **Drizzle ORM** for efficient and type-safe data management.
* **Modern Tooling:** Implemented with **TypeScript** for better maintainability and fewer runtime errors.
* **Professional Practices:** Includes **Linting, formatting, environment variables,** and **version control (Git)**.

## ðŸ’» Tech Stack

### Frontend (Client)

* **Framework:** [e.g., React, Vue.js, Svelte]
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Styling:** [e.g., Tailwind CSS, SCSS Modules]
* **Build Tool:** Vite

### Backend (Server)

* **Runtime:** Node.js
* **Framework:** Express
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Database:** [e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite]
* **ORM:** Drizzle

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following installed on your machine:

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone : https://github.com/Shikha18Shukla/My_portfolio
    cd CodePortfolio
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies for both client and server:**
    ```bash
    # Install server dependencies
    cd server
    npm install
    cd ..

    # Install client dependencies
    cd client
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the **`server`** directory and add your database connection strings and any necessary API keys.

    ```
    # Example .env content in the /server directory
    PORT=3000
    DATABASE_URL="your-database-connection-string"
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    In the `server` directory:
    ```bash
    npm run dev  # or similar script defined in your package.json
    ```
    The API will typically start on `http://localhost:3000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    In the `client` directory:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The client application will typically open at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port defined by your Vite configuration).
